                        Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. 
                        Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin formed 
                        the American crew that landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on 
                        July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC. Armstrong became the first person 
                        to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later 
                        on July 21 at 02:56 UTC; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later. 
                        They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, 
                        and they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth.
